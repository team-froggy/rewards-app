## bar-stats

### Developed At Alchemy Code Lab
* Easton (easton-john)
* Kevin (grayson073)
* Carmen (carmenvramos)

### Overview:

Assumptions for app environment/project:
* Payment application tied to bar/restaurant POS system (assume POS technology exists)
* User(s) can pay at table, find participating businesses
* Business owner(s) can identify "premium" customers (statistics on order/spend history)
* Premium users could then be sent specific promotions, event invites, etc.
* Potential: Developers/super users can glean overall data for market or stats for select businesses
